* In this branch, I removed the LCD / LED stuff, since I'm  working with the SD Card and just want to log temperature data for the rest of winter '13.

A single entry will reasonably take at most 25 chars. At a rate of 1 Hz, it comes out to about 2 Mb a day, so in 25 days when I get back it should be around 50 Mb. I've left it running with a 4 Gb SD card so it should be fine.

Code is set up such that if power resets on it, it'll go to next new log file and start writing there.
